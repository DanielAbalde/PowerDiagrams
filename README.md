<p align="center"> 2D Weighted Voronoi / Power Diagrams for Grasshopper</p>
<p align="center"> <img align="center" border="1px" src="Resources/Spiral.gif" alt="Gif"></p>



#### Motivation 
I was developing a project that needed the weighted voronoi in 3d when I got tired of finding problems with degenerated cases,
so I decided to implement it in 2d assuming that it would be easier to understand its causes and I thought it would be a good plugin to share to the Grasshopper community.
It turns out that in 2d there are also many degenerate cases that no paper on this subject really goes into depth, so, to finish and share it,
this project has eaten up the time of my initial project and the moral is that before trying to reduce the complexity of a problem
to another more manageable, consider developing the tools necessary to understand in depth what your code does,
because this was what I needed to solve it in 2d and what I should have done with the initial project to not lose my goal. 

The bad name of the plugin is due to the fact that I didn't want to make a separate component for each utility but unify them all
 in one to minimize the impact on the component bar, and because all utilities are derived from this triangulation,
 which is actually known as power diagram, it is like the native Delaunay component but with super powers.

The project is open to implement any other algorithm that can be built with the power diagram.

#### Installation
0) Download the last release of *SuperDelaunay.gha* from [here](https://github.com/DanielAbalde/Super-Delaunay/releases/tag/v1.0).
1) Unzip file.
2) Make sure *SuperDelaunay.gha* is <ins>unlocked</ins>, right click > Properties > Unlock (if visible).
3) Copy and paste it in the Grasshopper Libraries folder, usually: C:\Users\\<YourUser\>\AppData\Roaming\Grasshopper\Libraries.
4) Restart Rhinoceros and Grasshopper.
5) Component is located at *Mesh* Tab > *Triangulation* panel.

#### Usage
The component returns the Delaunay2d type that can be reused (to insert points or to extract some graph) 
without having to recalculate the triangulation. In order to support this in a single component, you can
change the input and output mode via right click in the component.

Mode | Description
--- | ---
Create new delaunay | Create a new delaunay from weighted points
Insert weighted points  | Insert weighted points in a existing delaunay
Extract only | Extract a subgraph or some property in a existing delaunay

The component also allows to customize the display colors of the Delaunay2d output.

#### Contributing
Please feel free to forge this project and share your improvements.
Using Visual Studio in Debug Mode, the GH component allows to open a debugger form (via double click on component)
to facilitate the analysis, you will need to uncomment all the StartTimer() and EndTimer() in the Delaunay2d.cs file to include the speed tests.
